SnapDismiss
===========

Quick demo of snapping an image of the background for a cleaner dismissal of a transparent modal view.

What you should hopefully see is a transparent view get presented over an orange background. On dismiss
the transparent modal view should slide cleanly down without updating to the new yellow background color.
Useful for drastic changes that occur to the background view based on the transparent modal dialog (for
example login).
